Description: Tinkerforge Brick Daemon
 The Brick Daemon program is part of the Tinkerforge software infrastructure.
 It routes Tinkerforge Protocol (TFP) messages between Tinkerforge USB devices
 (Bricks) and TCP/IP sockets. This allows user programs to use TCP/IP sockets
 to communicate with Bricks and their Bricklets connected to USB without having
 to deal with USB themselves. The TCP/IP communication itself is encapsulated
 in API bindings available for various programming languages.
