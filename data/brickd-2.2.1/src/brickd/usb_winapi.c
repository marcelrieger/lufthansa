 * brickd comes with its own libusb fork on Windows. therefore, it is not
 * affected by the hotplug race between brickd and libusb 1.0.16. see the long
 * comment in usb_posix.c for details.
 *
 * once libusb gains hotplug support for Windows and the libusb fork bundled
 * with brickd gets updated to include it brickd will also have to used the
 * hotplug handling in libusb on Windows. there is a similar race in event
 * handling to expect as on Linux and Mac OS X.
